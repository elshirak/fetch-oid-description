Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect  of invalidating the corresponding entry in the  ipNetToPhysicalTable. That is, it effectively dis-  associates the interface identified with said entry from the  mapping identified with said entry. It is an  implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent  removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly,  management stations must be prepared to receive tabular  information from agents that corresponds to entries not  currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries  requires examination of the relevant ipNetToPhysicalType  object.  The 'dynamic(3)' type indicates that the IP address to  physical addresses mapping has been dynamically resolved  using e.g., IPv4 ARP or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery  protocol.  The 'static(4)' type indicates that the mapping has been  statically configured. Both of these refer to entries that  provide mappings for other entities addresses.  The 'local(5)' type indicates that the mapping is provided  for an entity's own interface address.  As the entries in this table are typically not persistent  when this object is written the entity SHOULD NOT save the  change to non-volatile storage."  DEFVAL { static }

As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value.  An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface.  Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces."

Description: ifCounterDiscontinuityTime OBJECT-TYPE  SYNTAX TimeStamp  MAX-ACCESS read-only  STATUS current  DESCRIPTION  "The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which  any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a  discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific  instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or  Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If  no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re-  initialization of the local management subsystem, then this  object contains a zero value."

A system may use the larger values of this minimum to  lessen the impact of constant sampling. For larger  sampling intervals the system samples less often and  suffers less overhead. This object provides a way to enforce  such lower overhead for all triggers created after it is  set.  Unless explicitly resource limited, a system's value for  this object SHOULD be 1, allowing as small as a 1 second  interval for ongoing trigger sampling.  Changing this value will not invalidate an existing setting  of mteTriggerFrequency."

These are the entries that maintain state, one for each  instance of each sampled object as selected by  mteTriggerValueID. Note that wildcarded objects result  in multiple instances of this state.  A value of 0 indicates no preset limit, that is, the limit  is dynamic based on system operation and resources.  Unless explicitly resource limited, a system's value for  this object SHOULD be 0.  Changing this value will not eliminate or inhibit existing  sample state but could prevent allocation of additional state  information."
